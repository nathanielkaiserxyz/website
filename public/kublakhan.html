    In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br> 
    A stately pleasure-dome decree:<br>
    Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br>
    Through caverns measureless to man<br>
    Down to a sunless sea.<br>
    So twice five miles of fertile ground<br>
    With walls and towers were girdled round;<br>
    And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<br>
    Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;<br>
    And here were forests ancient as the hills,<br>
    Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.<br><br>

    But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted<br>
    Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!<br>
    A savage place! as holy and enchanted<br>
    As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted<br>
    By woman wailing for her demon-lover!<br>
    And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,<br>
    As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,<br>
    A mighty fountain momently was forced:<br>
    Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst<br>
    Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,<br>
    Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:<br>
    And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever<br>
    It flung up momently the sacred river.<br>
    Five miles meandering with a mazy motion<br>
    Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,<br>
    Then reached the caverns measureless to man,<br>
    And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean;<br>
    And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far<br>
    Ancestral voices prophesying war!<br>
    The shadow of the dome of pleasure<br>
    Floated midway on the waves;<br>
    Where was heard the mingled measure<br>
    From the fountain and the caves.<br>
    It was a miracle of rare device,<br>
    A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!<br><br>

    A damsel with a dulcimer<br>
    In a vision once I saw:<br>
    It was an Abyssinian maid,<br>
    And on her dulcimer she played,<br>
    Singing of Mount Abora.<br>
    Could I revive within me<br>
    Her symphony and song,<br>
    To such a deep delight 'twould win me,<br>
    That with music loud and long,<br>
    I would build that dome in air,<br>
    That sunny dome! those caves of ice!<br>
    And all who heard should see them there,<br>
    And all should cry, Beware! Beware!<br>
    His flashing eyes, his floating hair!<br>
    Weave a circle round him thrice,<br>
    And close your eyes with holy dread,<br>
    For he on honey-dew hath fed,<br>
    And drunk the milk of Paradise.<br></p>
