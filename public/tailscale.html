<h3>You should try Tailscale</h3>
<p>You should try tailscale

    You know all those incessant vpn ads you see on youtube, that amount to basically protect yourself online and disable web trackers. Yeah those are scams. Well not really, they do some of the things they advertise, but you probably don’t need them. It's helpful to think of what a vpn actually does, instead of your internet packets going from you to your destination, you are routed to a server, and then routed to your destination, going back though the same path. I really only see two benefits to this: the website you visit is obfuscated from where you are in the world, and the router that you connected to can’t see where you're going. 
    
    I don’t really mean to put down vpns in this video, they have real use cases. If youre in a country that blocks websites, or you don't want your local coffee shop to know company secrets because you work at aramco and still use telnet then vpns are a good idea. If youre just browsing the web, it's not going to prevent companies from collecting meaningful data on you though.
    
    The big secret that big VPN doesnt want you to know, is that TOR does privacy better then any of them. TOR is the internet’s cesspit that only really still exists because its a useful one. And probably because the us government made it. The way that TOR works is instead of you going to one server, you go to at least three relays that pass your traffic along until you reach your destination. If youre just browsing the internet, this is way better for your privacy, its extremely hard to see where you are coming from. The “problem” with tor is that its slow, all those relays make it not practical to use unless you have a reason.
    
    So why is this video about tailscale? Tailscale is a vpn service, but its a little different from the one I described earlier. Instead of you paying to connect to their servers tailscale provides the the ability for you to connect your own computers in a Virtual network. They have a great writeup on how it works, but the gist of it is that it allows you to connect up to 100 computers on the free tier. How does this replace a vpn? Aside from connecting your computers in a tailnet, you can designate computers as ‘exit nodes.’ This allows you to make a free vpn all on your own. I currently have a 16 year old thinkpad brick laptop I got from the neigbor running at my house as an exit node. So whenever I leave the house I can remote back to it for free. This is super cool because I can also connect to all my other computers and work on my projects from anywhere. What about the other use case though? When you want to bypass censorship or change location. Well I have an exit node through mullvad, but there’s free options too. Fly and oracle offer free tiers of vms that you can intstall a tailscale client on, 
    
    Tailscale is a really cool piece of software, I've never had any problems with it, and if you have a passing interest in computers its a great way to have fun connecting all of them
